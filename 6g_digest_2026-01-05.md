> **Relevance Score:** 3 (AI Impact: 7) | 📅 2026-01-05

The article introduces CTMAP, a framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and Digital Twins to solve connectivity issues in mmWave 6G networks. By using ray-tracing simulations to create signal-aware maps, it trains a GPT-4 based model to provide semantic, connectivity-optimized navigation, significantly outperforming traditional distance-based path planning.

### [Multi-Satellite NOMA-Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA for IoT Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00341)
> **Relevance Score:** 3 (AI Impact: 7) | 📅 2026-01-05

This research addresses the challenges of massive IoT connectivity in the 6G era by proposing a Multi-Satellite NOMA-Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA (IRSA) protocol. It leverages the receiver diversity provided by mega-constellations to mitigate collision probabilities and enhance system capacity in Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs).
