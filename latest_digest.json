Conventional navigation tools optimize only distance, time, or cost, overlooking network connectivity degradation caused by signal blockage in dense urban environments. The proposed framework constructs a digital twin of the physical mmWave network using OpenStreetMap, Blender, and NVIDIA Sionna's ray-tracing engine to simulate realistic received signal strength (RSS) maps. A modified Dijkstra algorithm then generates optimal routes that maximize cumulative RSS, forming the training data for instruction-tuned GPT-4-based reasoning. This integration enables semantic route queries such as ``find the strongest-signal path'' and returns connectivity-optimized paths that are interpretable by users and adaptable to real-time environmental updates. Experimental results demonstrate that CTMAP achieves up to a tenfold improvement in cumulative signal strength compared to shortest-distance baselines, while maintaining high path validity. The synergy of digital twin simulation and LLM reasoning establishes a scalable foundation for intelligent, interpretable, and connectivity-driven navigation, advancing the design of AI-empowered 6G mobility systems.",

Accommodating this surge and meeting the high capacity demands will necessitate the integration of NonTerrestrial Networks (NTNs). However, the extensive coverage area of satellites, relative to terrestrial receivers, will lead to a high density of users attempting to access the channel at the same time, increasing the collision probability. In turn, the deployment of mega constellations make it possible for ground users to be in visibility of more than one satellite at the same time, enabling receiver diversity. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate the impact of multi-receivers in scenarios where IoT nodes share the channel following a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) protocol. Considering the impairments of satellite channels, we derive a lower bound of system performance, serving as a fast tool for initial evaluation of network behavior. Additionally, we identify the trade-offs inherent to the network design parameters, with a focus on packet loss rate and energy efficiency. Notably, in the visibility of only one extra satellite as receiver yields significant gains in overall system performance.",
