One example of that is small modular reactors (SMRs). These nuclear fission reactors are less than a third of the size and power output of conventional reactors. And as the April deadline approached for <span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-modular-reactor-united-states\" target=\"_self\"><span>applying for the US $900 million the United States was offering for SMR development</span></a></span>, readers came to <em>S</em><em>pectrum</em> in droves to learn about the program in a news article authored by contributor <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/shannon-cuthrell\" target=\"_self\">Shannon Cuthrell</a>.</p><p>But the SMR money paled in comparison to the $80 billion that the United States is spending on a fleet of large-scale nuclear reactors designed by Westinghouse. Will this next group of reactors suffer from the same delays and cost overruns as the ones that put Westinghouse into bankruptcy just a few years ago? <em>Spectrum</em> brought readers <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/80-billion-us-nuclear-power\" target=\"_blank\">an expert analysis on the subject</a> by Wood MacKenzie\u2019s Ed Crooks.</p><h2>2. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chinas-thorium-molten-salt-reactor\" target=\"_self\">Why China is Building a Thorium Molten-Salt Reactor</a></h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Part of a periodic table with light coming out from the &quot;Thorium&quot; element.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"26551\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/part-of-a-periodic-table-with-light-coming-out-from-the-thorium-element.png?id=55383413&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Edmon de Haro        </small> </p><p>The United States may have the most SMRs in development, but China has the one that\u2019s furthest along. The Linglong One, on the island of Hainan, is expected to begin operations in the first half of 2026. And that\u2019s just one component in a smorgasbord of nuclear reactor experimentation in China. One of the country\u2019s most interesting projects is a<span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chinas-thorium-molten-salt-reactor\" target=\"_self\"> thorium-powered, molten-salt reactor</a></span>, which it began building in 2025 in the Gobi desert. Prior to this project, the last operating molten-salt reactor was at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which shut down in 1969.</p><p>The attraction of thorium as a fuel is that it reduces dependence on uranium.

And the biggest obstacle to bigger wind\u2014besides the present political backlash\u2014is transportation. Roads, bridges, and train tracks dictate the size of on-shore wind turbine blades, and usually can\u2019t accommodate anything over 70 meters long.

But many key transmission corridors are maxed. Blackouts are growing longer and more common. Building new transmission lines takes years and often gets thwarted by NIMBY pushback. Queues for connecting to the grid, whether you\u2019re providing power or requesting it, can be comically long.</p><p>To bridge the gap, grid operators globally are turning to innovative grid tech. Collectively called grid-enhancing technologies (GETs), some of the boldest examples can be found in the United Kingdom. For example, the U.K.\u2019s National Grid has been <span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/grid-congestion-uk\" target=\"_self\"><span>implementing electronic power-flow controllers</span></a></span>, called SmartValves, that shift electricity from jammed circuits to those with spare capacity.</p><p>The U.K. and other countries have also been <span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/grid-enhancing-technologies\" target=\"_self\"><span>reconductoring</span></a></span> old lines and <span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/dynamic-line-rating-grid-congestion\" target=\"_self\"><span>installing dynamic line rating</span></a></span>, which calculates how much current high-voltage lines can safely carry based on real-time weather conditions. And <span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/grid-scale-battery-scotland\" target=\"_self\"><span>Scotland has been beefing up its grid-scale battery stations</span></a></span> with advanced converters.

These devices store energy in the form of radioactive isotopes. They can last for decades, making them ideal for medical implants, remote infrastructure, robots, and sensors. But the allure of a small battery with a 50-year lifespan has given this sector several false starts. There was a stint in the 1970s where surgeons implanted nuclear-powered pacemakers in over 1,400 people only to lose track of them over time. Regulators balked when devices containing plutonium-238 started turning up in crematoriums and coffins.</p><p>Now the field is experiencing a resurgence in interest.

And instead of targeting the stomach or brain, it focused on the gut itself: rewiring how a part of the upper intestine, known as the <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/duodenum\" target=\"_blank\">duodenum</a>, processes nutrients and regulates metabolism.</p><p>Performed via a minimally invasive endoscopic device, this approach is designed to help people who want to stop taking GLP-1 drugs. The goal is to lock in the benefits without the high costs, weekly jabs, or lingering side effects. And in 2026, the first company to develop such a device is likely to seek clearance to bring it to patients.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re creating a new therapeutic area,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.fractyl.com/team/harith-rajagopalan-md-phd/\" target=\"_blank\">Harith Rajagopalan</a>, cofounder and chief executive of that company, <a href=\"https://www.fractyl.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fractyl Health</a>, based in Burlington, Mass.</p><h2>Resetting Metabolism for Lasting Weight Loss </h2><p>You can think of these systems as a middle ground between drugs and bariatric surgery. The endoscope is a slim, flexible tube equipped with a camera and a guidewire that leads a catheter into the digestive system. Doctors send the tools down the throat so they can view and modify the intestines from the inside\u2014remodeling gut tissue and recalibrating its response to food without a single incision. The procedure takes about an hour or so, and patients typically go home the same day.</p><p>To understand how the treatment works, it helps to first understand what goes wrong in the gut during years of unhealthy eating. As diets high in sugar and fat bombard the duodenum, the lining there becomes inflamed and its normal signaling pathways distorted. Mucosal cells in the tissue grow abnormally and propagate these maladaptive changes, locking in a dysfunctional pattern that drives cravings, weight gain, and insulin resistance.</p><p>The Fractyl device overcomes these entrenched changes. It works by deliberately injuring the tissue, using near-boiling water to burn off diseased cells on the intestinal lining. A natural healing process then kicks in, producing a fresh layer of healthy tissue and re-establishing proper metabolic control.</p><p>\u201cYou see regrowth at about two weeks, and it continues until the mucosa looks pretty normal,\u201d says <a href=\"https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/mpb/person/alan-d-cherrington-phd/\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Cherrington</a>, a physiologist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine who consults for Fractyl.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26638897/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div><p><a href=\"https://ir.fractyl.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fractyl-health-announces-groundbreaking-data-remain-1-midpoint\" target=\"_blank\">Preliminary results</a> from the clinical trial that Christina joined, termed the <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06484114\" target=\"_blank\">Remain-1 study</a>, indicate that the procedure is working as intended to stabilize weight after GLP-1 therapy. Three months after stopping Zepbound, study participants who underwent the Fractyl procedure generally held their weight steady or continued to lose weight, while those who received a sham treatment saw the number on their scales climb steadily upward.</p><p>The results are \u201chonestly better than I thought they were going to be,\u201d says one of the doctors leading the trial, <a href=\"https://providers.dartmouth-health.org/2233/shelby-a-sullivan\" target=\"_blank\">Shelby Sullivan</a>, a gastroenterologist and obesity-medicine specialist at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.</p><p>Sullivan cautions against drawing firm conclusions, given the small number of participants and short follow-up so far. But anyone watching the field won\u2019t have to wait long for clearer answers. \u201cBy six months,\u201d she says, \u201cwe absolutely will know if it\u2019s working or not.\u201d</p><h2>Next-Generation Devices for Obesity  </h2><p>If the six-month data demonstrate lasting weight maintenance\u2014full trial readouts are expected in 2026\u2014Fractyl then intends to seek regulatory clearance to market what could become the first device specifically sanctioned for post-GLP-1 weight control.</p><p>But Fractyl is hardly alone in pursuing this therapeutic frontier. <a href=\"https://www.endogenex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Endogenex</a>, a company based in Plymouth, Minn., is using a flexible, expandable circuit board to apply pulsed electric fields directly to the duodenal wall to burn away the problem cells. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://en.tecure.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TeCure</a>, in South Korea, and <a href=\"https://aquaendoscopy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aqua Medical</a>, in Pleasanton, Calif., are using lasers and radiofrequency-heated water vapor, respectively, to achieve a similar remodeling of the gut lining.</p><p>\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s different methods to do the same thing,\u201d says <a href=\"https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/13872/pichamol-jirapinyo-gastroenterology_hepatology_and_endoscopy-boston-foxborough-jamaica_plain\" target=\"_blank\">Pichamol Jirapinyo</a>, a bariatric endoscopist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a cofounder of <a href=\"https://bariendo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bariendo</a>, a network of 10 nonsurgical weight-loss clinics across the United States. While ongoing trials may clarify differences in efficacy and safety, Jirapinyo (who consults for Fractyl) expects operational features such as ease of use and procedure time to play a decisive role in determining uptake among practitioners.</p><p>Timing of market entry is critical, too\u2014and Fractyl, now leading the pack, is expected to deliver the first large-scale clinical results. Those outcomes, from the trial that Sullivan is leading, could set the tone for an entire class of new device-based obesity treatments aiming to preserve the gains of GLP-1 drugs, notes Endogenex CEO <a href=\"https://www.endogenex.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Stacey Pugh</a>. \u201cIf they are successful, it\u2019s going to blow this field wide open,\u201d she says.</p><h2>Alternative Post-GLP-1 Devices </h2><p>Not everyone is convinced that resurfacing the duodenum is the way to go. In Europe, the past year saw the arrival of a new weight-loss device called <a href=\"https://morphicmedical.com/reset/\" target=\"_blank\">Reset</a> that\u2014while not explicitly authorized for use in a post-GLP-1 drug setting\u2014introduces a sleevelike liner to the duodenum that physically prevents contact between food and the gut wall. That device must be removed within a year, however, offering only a temporary fix.</p><p>Other endoscopic approaches target the stomach: <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/endoscopic-sleeve-gastroplasty\" target=\"_blank\">One in common use today</a> applies sutures to fold the stomach and shrink its size, while <a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016-5085(24)05349-6\" target=\"_blank\">another, more experimental method</a> burns off stomach tissue that regulates the secretion of appetite-stimulating hormones.</p><p>These stomach-directed methods may offer a logistical advantage given the relative robustness and accessibility of the stomach, explains <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-c-storm-m-d-93414431/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Storm</a>, a therapeutic endoscopist at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. \u201cThe duodenum is paper thin, as compared to the stomach, which is like a thick neoprene bag,\u201d he says.</p><p>Regulatory clearance for Fractyl would allow the company to directly promote its product for post-GLP-1 weight maintenance\u2014something that <a href=\"https://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Boston Scientific</a>, maker of the <a href=\"https://www.bostonscientific.com/en-EU/medical-specialties/bariatric-endoscopy/endoscopic-sleeve-gastroplasty.html\" target=\"_blank\">most widely used stomach-suturing device</a>, is not legally permitted to do unless it engages in a new round of clinical trials. And that distinction could give duodenal therapies an edge in marketing. But Storm, who consults for Boston Scientific and has also participated in trials of the Endogenex system, raises concerns about the complexity of duodenal therapy. \u201cIt just introduces a whole other level of difficulty for the endoscopist that that I think will impact scalability,\u201d he says.</p><h2>Holding On to Hard-Won Progress </h2><p>For patients like Christina, the debate over stomach versus duodenum, or one company\u2019s device versus another\u2019s, is largely academic. What matters for her is that the 50 pounds she lost on Zepbound\u2014nearly 20 percent of her body weight\u2014has stayed off so far, a stability that she attributes to the Fractyl device. Because the trial is randomized and blinded, it is possible she actually received the sham procedure. But Christina is fairly confident that she got the real thing.</p><p>Her reasoning comes from small but telling moments, like when her husband was cooking smoked pork burnt ends, sending up the kind of rich aromas that once would have sent her straight to the table. \u201cIt smelled really good, but I didn\u2019t have any desire to chow down on it,\u201d Christina says.</p><p>Experiences like Christina\u2019s hint at the tantalizing promise of a lasting solution after drug-assisted weight loss, but medical-device development demands more than anecdotes. With pivotal trial readouts on the horizon, the year ahead could determine whether these devices remain hopeful prototypes or become validated tools in the next era of obesity care. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>",

The research surveyed around 2,000 technology and business decision-makers in the U.S. and Europe, including telecommunication and data center infrastructure providers, as well as businesses and organizations planning to adopt and integrate AI into their operations.</span></p><p><span>The findings highlight a shared recognition across the connectivity ecosystem that next-generation network capabilities are essential and must modernize to support increasingly complex AI workloads. This presents an opportunity for collective action across industry and government to strengthen the digital foundation on which future AI innovation depends.</span></p><p><span>The research explains why this evolution matters, with AI redefining network requirements: workloads are becoming more uplink-heavy, data flows are more distributed, and expectations around latency, throughput, resilience, security, and energy efficiency are rising. These changes carry implications not only for telecommunication providers, AI and cloud providers, and mission-critical enterprises, but for national competitiveness and long-term digital leadership.</span></p><p><span>AI applications \u2013 from autonomous vehicles and smart manufacturing lines to surveillance drones and remote health care diagnostics \u2013 generate large volumes of data at the edge that must be transmitted upstream for processing, making them uplink-intensive. This stresses today\u2019s networks, which were originally engineered for downlink-focused consumer use, such as browsing websites and video streaming.</span></p><p><span>Nokia is encouraging collaboration across the network ecosystem and support for more simplified and predictable regulatory environments that enable timely network investment. The research commissioned by Nokia includes perspectives from operators, enterprises, and partners about the capabilities they need from next-generation infrastructure to scale AI effectively. The research is broken down into separate geographic reports.</span></p><h3><span><strong>United States</strong></span></h3><p><span>While the U.S. continues to lead global AI deployment and mass-market adoption, 88% of U.S. respondents expressed concern that the expansion of network infrastructure may not keep pace with AI investment.</span></p><p><span>Respondents identified bi-directional data flow optimization, expanded fiber capacity, real-time training feedback, and low-latency edge infrastructure as essential priorities and building blocks for modernizing network architecture and powering the next phase of AI growth.</span></p><p><span>The U.S.-focused report, \u201cInfrastructure First Is the New America First\u201d, can be found </span><a href=\"https://onestore.nokia.com/asset/215238\"><span>here</span></a>.</p><h3><span><strong>Europe</strong></span></h3><p><span>In Europe, 86% of enterprise respondents said current networks are not yet equipped to handle widespread AI adoption. Two-thirds of those surveyed said they already have AI in live use, and more than half have already experienced challenges such as downtime, latency, and throughput constraints associated with increasing data demands.</span></p><p><span>To address these challenges, respondents emphasized the need for consistent regulatory simplification and alignment across markets, timely spectrum availability, adjustments in competition policy to enable market consolidation, and industry-wide investment in energy-efficient, AI-ready networks.</span></p><p><span>These findings can be found in the \u201cAI is too big for the European Internet\u201d report </span><a href=\"https://onestore.nokia.com/asset/215237\"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span><strong>Multimedia, technical information and related news</strong></span></p><ul><li><span>Press Release: </span><a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/newsroom/nokia-unveils-strategy-to-capture-value-from-ai-supercycle/\"><span>Nokia unveils strategy to capture value from AI supercycle</span></a></li></ul>",
