Whether you\u2019re looking for a new job or seeking strategies to excel in your current role, read on for the three most popular recommendations that could help advance your career.<br /></p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/getting-past-procastination\" target=\"_blank\">1. Getting Past Procrastination</a></h2><p>Across a decade working at hypergrowth tech companies like Meta and Pinterest, I constantly struggled with procrastination. I\u2019d be assigned an important project, but I simply couldn\u2019t get myself to start it. The source of my distraction varied\u2014I would constantly check my email, read random documentation, or even scroll through my social feeds. But the result was the same: I felt a deep sense of dread that I was not making progress on the things that mattered.</p><p>At the end of the day, time is the only resource that matters. With every minute, you are making a decision about how to spend your life. Most of the ways people spend their time are ineffective. Especially in the tech world, our tasks and tools are constantly changing, so we must be able to adapt. What separates the best engineers from the rest of the pack is that they create systems that allow them to be consistently productive.</p><p>Here\u2019s the core idea that changed my perspective on productivity: Action leads to motivation, not the other way around. You should not check your email or scroll Instagram while you wait for motivation to \u201chit you.\u201d Instead, just start doing something, anything, that makes progress toward your goal, and you\u2019ll find that motivation will follow.\u2026</p><p><em><em>Read the full newsletter </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/getting-past-procastination\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>here</em></em></a><em><em>.</em></em></p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/improving-interview-odds\" target=\"_blank\">2. Improve Your Chances of Landing That Job Interview</a></h2><p>One of my close friends is a hiring manager at Google. She recently posted about an open position on her team and was immediately overwhelmed with applications. We\u2019re talking about thousands of applicants within days.</p><p>What surprised me most, however, was the horrendous quality of the average submission. Most applicants were obviously unqualified or had concocted entirely fake profiles. The use of generative AI to automatically fill out (and, in some cases, even submit) applications is harmful to everyone; employers are unable to filter through the noise, and legitimate candidates have a harder time getting noticed\u2014much less advancing to an interview.</p><p>So how can job seekers stand out among the deluge of candidates? When there are hundreds or thousands of applicants, the best way to distinguish yourself is by leveraging your network.</p><p>With AI, anyone with a computer can trivially apply to thousands of jobs. On the other hand, people are restricted by Dunbar\u2019s number\u2014the idea that humans can maintain stable social relationships with only about 150 people. Being one of those 150 people is harder, but it also carries more weight than a soulless job application.</p><p><em><em>Read the full newsletter </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/improving-interview-odds\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>here</em></em></a><em><em>.</em></em></p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/learning-coding-age-of-ai\" target=\"_blank\">3. Learning to Code Still Matters in the Age of AI</a></h2><p>Cursor, the AI-native code editor, <a href=\"https://x.com/amanrsanger/status/1916968123535880684\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recently reported</a> that it writes nearly a billion lines of code daily. That\u2019s one billion lines of production-grade code accepted by users every single day. If we generously assume that a strong engineer writes a thousand lines of code in a day, Cursor is doing the equivalent work of a million developers. (For context, while working at Pinterest and Meta, I\u2019d typically write less than 100 lines of code per day.)</p><p>There are only about 25 million software developers worldwide! Naively, it appears that Cursor is making a meaningful percentage of coders obsolete.</p><p>This begs the question: Is it even worth learning to code anymore?</p><p>The answer is a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d The above fear-based analysis of Cursor misses several important points.\u2026</p><p><em><em>Read the full newsletter </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/learning-coding-age-of-ai\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>here</em></em></a><em><em>. </em></em></p><p>\u2014Rahul<br /></p>",
