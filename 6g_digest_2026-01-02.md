### [AI Data Centers Demand More Than Copper Can Deliver](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rf-over-fiber)
> **Relevance Score:** 3 (AI Impact: 8) | 📅 2025-12-27

This article discusses the transition from copper and optical interconnects to millimeter-wave and terahertz radio-based cables for AI data centers. As AI scaling demands exceed copper's physical limits (the 'copper cliff'), startups like Point2 and AttoTude are leveraging high-frequency radio (sub-THz/THz) to deliver low-power, high-bandwidth, and low-latency connections essential for the high-density GPU clusters that will underpin 6G AI-native architectures.
