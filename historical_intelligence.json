The skies are usually clear, the air is arid, and the electronic din of civilization is far away.</p><p>It was to one of these places, in the high desert of New Mexico, that a young astronomer named <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/burns/\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Burns</a> went to study radio jets and quasars far beyond the Milky Way. It was 1979, he was just out of grad school, and the <a href=\"https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vla/\" target=\"_blank\">Very Large Array</a>, a constellation of 28 giant dish antennas on an open plain, was a new mecca of radio astronomy.</p><p>But the VLA had its limitations\u2014namely, that Earth\u2019s protective atmosphere and ionosphere blocked many parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and that, even in a remote desert, earthly interference was never completely gone.</p><p>Could there be a better, even lonelier place to put a radio telescope? Sure, a NASA planetary scientist named <a href=\"https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/NASA_HQ/SMD/MendellWW/MendellWW_9-20-17.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Wendell Mendell</a>, told Burns: How about the moon? He asked if Burns had ever thought about building one there.</p><p>\u201cMy immediate reaction was no. Maybe even hell, no. Why would I want to do that?\u201d Burns recalls with a self-deprecating smile. His work at the VLA had gone well, he was fascinated by cosmology\u2019s big questions, and he didn\u2019t want to be slowed by the bureaucratic slog of getting funding to launch a new piece of hardware.</p><p>But Mendell suggested he do some research and speak at a conference on future lunar observatories, and Burns\u2019s thinking about a space-based radio telescope began to shift. That was in 1984. In the four decades since, he\u2019s published more than <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_database_fq_database=OR&amp;filter_database_fq_database=database%3A%22astronomy%22&amp;format=SHORT&amp;fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&amp;fq_database=(database%3A%22astronomy%22)&amp;q=%3Dauthor%3A(%22burns%2C%20jack%22%20OR%20%22burns%2C%20jack%20o.%22%20OR%20%22burns%2C%20j.o.%22)&amp;sort=score%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;unprocessed_parameter=qform&amp;unprocessed_parameter=Require%20Field%20for%20Selection&amp;p_=0\" target=\"_blank\">500 peer-reviewed papers</a> on radio astronomy.

And while doing all that, Burns has had an ongoing second job of sorts, as a quietly persistent advocate for radio astronomy from space.</p><p>And early next year, if all goes well, a radio telescope for which he\u2019s a scientific investigator will be launched\u2014not just into space, not just to the moon, but to the moon\u2019s far side, where it will observe things invisible from Earth.</p><p>\u201cYou can see we don\u2019t lack for ambition after all these years,\u201d says Burns, now 73 and a professor emeritus of astrophysics at <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/burns/about-jack\" target=\"_blank\">the University of Colorado Boulder</a>.</p><p>The instrument is called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10345\" target=\"_blank\">LuSEE-Night</a>, short for <a href=\"https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=122408\" target=\"_blank\">Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment\u2013Night</a><a href=\"https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/lunar-science/lunar-landers/Firefly_Blue%20Ghost%20Mission%202_2025.jpg?w=2689&amp;h=1513&amp;fit=clip&amp;crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint\" target=\"_blank\">.</a> It will be launched from Florida aboard a SpaceX rocket and carried to the moon\u2019s far side atop a squat four-legged robotic spacecraft called <a href=\"https://fireflyspace.com/missions/blue-ghost-mission-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Ghost Mission 2</a>, built and operated by <a href=\"https://fireflyspace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefly Aerospace</a> of Cedar Park, Texas.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Illustration of a four-legged structure with solar panels on the sides on the surface of the moon. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f6e66\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-a-four-legged-structure-with-solar-panels-on-the-sides-on-the-surface-of-the-moon.png?id=62815356&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In an artist\u2019s rendering, the LuSEE-Night radio telescope sits atop Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost 2 lander, which will carry it to the moon\u2019s far side. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Firefly Aerospace </small></p><p>Landing will be <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lunar-landing\" target=\"_self\">risky</a>: Blue Ghost 2 will be on its own, in a place that\u2019s out of the sight of ground controllers. But Firefly\u2019s <a href=\"https://fireflyspace.com/missions/blue-ghost-mission-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Ghost 1</a> pulled off the first successful landing by a private company on the moon\u2019s near side in March 2025. And Burns has already put hardware on the lunar surface, albeit with mixed results: An experiment he helped conceive was on board a lander called <a href=\"https://www.intuitivemachines.com/im-1\" target=\"_blank\">Odysseus</a>, built by Houston-based <a href=\"https://www.intuitivemachines.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Intuitive Machines</a>, in 2024. Odysseus was damaged on landing, but Burns\u2019s experiment still returned some useful data.</p><p>Burns says he\u2019d be bummed about that 2024 mission if there weren\u2019t so many more coming up. He\u2019s joined in proposing myriad designs for radio telescopes that could go to the moon. And he\u2019s kept going through political disputes, technical delays, even a confrontation with cancer. Finally, finally, the effort is paying off.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting our feet into the lunar soil,\u201d says Burns, \u201cand understanding what is possible with these radio telescopes in a place where we\u2019ve never observed before.\u201d</p><h2>Why Go to the Far Side of the Moon? </h2><p>A moon-based radio telescope could help unravel some of the greatest mysteries in space science. Dark matter, dark energy, neutron stars, and gravitational waves could all come into better focus if observed from the moon. One of Burns\u2019s collaborators on LuSEE-Night, astronomer <a href=\"https://pma.caltech.edu/people/gregg-w-hallinan\" target=\"_blank\">Gregg Hallinan</a> of Caltech, would like such a telescope to further his research on <a href=\"https://www.kiss.caltech.edu/impact/Hallinan.html\" target=\"_blank\">electromagnetic activity around exoplanets</a>, a possible measure of whether these distant worlds are habitable. Burns himself is especially interested in the <a href=\"https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/physics-of-cosmic-dark-ages-100436.html\" target=\"_blank\">cosmic dark ages</a>, an epoch that began more than 13 billion years ago, just 380,000 years after the big bang. The young universe had cooled enough for neutral hydrogen atoms to form, which trapped the light of stars and galaxies. The dark ages lasted between 200 million and 400 million years.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-timeline\"><noscript><img alt=\"timeline visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27231096/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div><p class=\"caption\">LuSEE-Night will listen for faint signals from the cosmic dark ages, a period that began about 380,000 years after the big bang, when neutral hydrogen atoms had begun to form, trapping the light of stars and galaxies. <span class=\"media-photo-credit\">Chris Philpot</span></p><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a critical period in the history of the universe,\u201d says Burns. \u201cBut we have no data from it.\u201d</span></p><p>The problem is that residual radio signals from this epoch are very faint and easily drowned out by closer noise\u2014in particular, our earthly communications networks, power grids, radar, and so forth. The sun adds its share, too. What\u2019s more, these early signals have been dramatically redshifted by the expansion of the universe, their wavelengths stretched as their sources have sped away from us over billions of years. The most critical example is neutral hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, which when excited in the laboratory emits a radio signal with a wavelength of 21 centimeters. Indeed, with just <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/software-defined-radio\" target=\"_self\">some backyard equipment</a>, you can easily detect neutral hydrogen in nearby galactic gas clouds close to that wavelength, which corresponds to a frequency of 1.42 gigahertz. But if the hydrogen signal originates from the dark ages, those 21 centimeters are lengthened to tens of meters. That means scientists need to listen to frequencies well below 50 megahertz\u2014parts of the radio spectrum that are largely blocked by Earth\u2019s ionosphere.</p><p>Which is why the lunar far side holds such appeal. It may just be the quietest site in the inner solar system.</p><p>\u201cIt really is the only place in the solar system that never faces the Earth,\u201d says <a href=\"https://astro.berkeley.edu/people/david-deboer/\" target=\"_blank\">David DeBoer</a>, a research astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt really is kind of a wonderful, unique place.\u201d</p><p>For radio astronomy, things get even better during the lunar night, when the sun drops beneath the horizon and is blocked by the moon\u2019s mass. For up to 14 Earth-days at a time, a spot on the moon\u2019s far side is about as electromagnetically dark as any place in the inner solar system can be. No radiation from the sun, no confounding signals from Earth. There may be signals from a few distant space probes, but otherwise, ideally, your antenna only hears the raw noise of the cosmos<strong>.</strong></p><p>\u201cWhen you get down to those very low radio frequencies, there\u2019s a source of noise that appears that\u2019s associated with the solar wind,\u201d says Caltech\u2019s Hallinan. Solar wind is the stream of charged particles that speed relentlessly from the sun. \u201cAnd the only location where you can escape that within a billion kilometers of the Earth is on the lunar surface, on the nighttime side. The solar wind screams past it, and you get a cavity where you can hide away from that noise.\u201d</p><h2>How Does LuSEE-Night Work? </h2><p>LuSEE-Night\u2019s receiver looks simple, though there\u2019s really nothing simple about it. Up top are <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07173v1#S2\" target=\"_blank\">two dipole antennas</a>, each of which consists of two collapsible rods pointing in opposite directions. The dipole antennas are mounted perpendicular to each other on a small <a href=\"https://physicalsciences.lbl.gov/2025/09/15/berkeley-lab-engineer-designs-hardware-for-the-moons-unforgiving-environment/\" target=\"_blank\">turntable</a>, forming an X when seen from above. Each dipole antenna extends to about 6 meters. The turntable sits atop a box of support equipment that\u2019s a bit less than a cubic meter in volume; the equipment bay, in turn, sits atop the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/lunar-science/clps-deliveries/cs-3/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Ghost 2</a> lander, a boxy spacecraft about 2 meters tall.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A person wearing a hairnet, facemask, and vinyl gloves working on a shiny metal apparatus.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3e129\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-person-wearing-a-hairnet-facemask-and-vinyl-gloves-working-on-a-shiny-metal-apparatus.png?id=62822192&amp;width=980\" /> </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A photo of people wearing hairnets, facemasks, and vinyl gloves working on a shiny metal apparatus. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"341a7\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-photo-of-people-wearing-hairnets-facemasks-and-vinyl-gloves-working-on-a-shiny-metal-apparatus.png?id=62822190&amp;width=980\" /> </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A person wearing a hairnet, facemask, and vinyl gloves working on a shiny metal apparatus.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"76e4f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-person-wearing-a-hairnet-facemask-and-vinyl-gloves-working-on-a-shiny-metal-apparatus.png?id=62822146&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">LuSEE-Night undergoes final assembly [top and center] at the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, and testing [bottom] at Firefly Aerospace outside Austin, Texas. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">From top: Space Sciences Laboratory/University of California, Berkeley (2); Firefly Aerospace </small></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful instrument,\u201d says <a href=\"https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/stuart-bale\" target=\"_blank\">Stuart Bale</a>, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is NASA\u2019s principal investigator for the project. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what the radio sky looks like at these frequencies without the sun in the sky. I think that\u2019s what LuSEE-Night will give us.\u201d</p><p>The apparatus was designed to serve several incompatible needs: It had to be sensitive enough to detect very weak signals from deep space; rugged enough to withstand the extremes of the lunar environment; and quiet enough to not interfere with its own observations, yet loud enough to talk to Earth via relay satellite as needed. Plus the instrument had to stick to a budget of about US $40 million and not weigh more than 120 kilograms. The mission plan calls for two years of operations.</p><p>The antennas are made of a beryllium copper alloy, chosen for its high conductivity and stability as lunar temperatures plummet or soar by as much as 250 \u00b0C every time the sun rises or sets. LuSEE-Night will make precise voltage measurements of the signals it receives, using a high-impedance junction field-effect transistor to act as an amplifier for each antenna. The signals are then fed into a spectrometer\u2014the main science instrument\u2014which reads those voltages at <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10345\" target=\"_blank\">102.4 million samples per second</a>. That high read-rate is meant to prevent the exaggeration of any errors as faint signals are amplified. Scientists believe that a cosmic dark-ages signature would be five to six orders of magnitude weaker than the other signals that LuSEE-Night will record.</p><p>The turntable is there to help characterize the signals the antennas receive, so that, among other things, an ancient dark-ages signature can be distinguished from closer, newer signals from, say, galaxies or interstellar gas clouds. Data from the early universe should be virtually <a href=\"https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1973ApJ...180..317C%22%3ECollins\" target=\"_blank\">isotropic</a>, meaning that it comes from all over the sky, regardless of the antennas\u2019 orientation. Newer signals are more likely to come from a specific direction. Hence the turntable: If you collect data over the course of a lunar night, then reorient the antennas and listen again, you\u2019ll be better able to distinguish the distant from the very, very distant.</p><p>What\u2019s the ideal lunar <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07173v1#S3\" target=\"_blank\">landing spot</a> if you want to take such readings? One as nearly opposite Earth as possible, on a flat plain. Not an easy thing to find on the moon\u2019s hummocky far side, but mission planners pored over maps made by lunar satellites and chose a prime location about 24 degrees south of the lunar equator.</p><p>Other lunar telescopes have been proposed for placement in the permanently shadowed craters near the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/moon-base\" target=\"_self\">moon\u2019s south pole</a>, just over the horizon when viewed from Earth. Such craters are coveted for the water ice they may hold, and the low temperatures in them (below -240 \u00b0C) are great if you\u2019re doing infrared astronomy and need to keep your instruments cold. But the location is terrible if you\u2019re working in long-wavelength radio.</p><p>\u201cEven the inside of such craters would be hard to shield from Earth-based radio frequency interference (RFI) signals,\u201d <a href=\"https://leonkoopmans.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Leon Koopmans</a> of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, said in an email. \u201cThey refract off the crater rims and often, due to their long wavelength, simply penetrate right through the crater rim.\u201d</p><p>RFI is a major\u2014and sometimes maddening\u2014issue for sensitive instruments. The first-ever landing on the lunar far side was by the Chinese <a href=\"https://www.cnsa.gov.cn/english/n6465652/n6465653/c6805233/content.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chang\u2019e 4</a> spacecraft, in 2019. It carried a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022RS007595\" target=\"_blank\">low-frequency radio spectrometer</a>, among other experiments. But it failed to return meaningful results, Chinese researchers said, mostly because of interference from the spacecraft itself.</p><h2>The Accidental Birth of Radio Astronomy </h2><p>Sometimes, though, a little interference makes history. Here, it\u2019s worth a pause to remember <a href=\"https://legacy.nrao.edu/epo/aoc/puente/jansky/hist_jansky.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Karl Jansky</a>, considered the <a href=\"https://aas.org/posts/news/2018/07/month-astronomical-history-1\" target=\"_blank\">father of radio astronomy</a>. In 1928, he was a young engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, N.J., assigned to isolate <a href=\"https://www.aps.org/archives/publications/apsnews/201505/physicshistory.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">sources of static in shortwave transatlantic telephone calls</a>. Two years later, he built a <a href=\"https://www.bigear.org/CSMO/HTML/CS12/cs12p08.htm\" target=\"_blank\">30-meter-long directional antenna</a>, mostly out of brass and wood, and after accounting for thunderstorms and the like, there was still noise he couldn\u2019t explain. At first, its strength seemed to follow a daily cycle, rising and sinking with the sun. But after a few months\u2019 observation, the sun and the noise were badly out of sync.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a man standing in a field in front of a large structure made of crisscrossing segments and resting on wheels. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8d525\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-man-standing-in-a-field-in-front-of-a-large-structure-made-of-crisscrossing-segments-and-resting-on-w.png?id=62821778&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In 1930, Karl Jansky, a Bell Labs engineer in Holmdel, N.J., built this rotating antenna on wheels to identify sources of static for radio communications.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">NRAO/AUI/NSF </small></p><p>It gradually became clear that the noise\u2019s period wasn\u2019t 24 hours; it was 23 hours and 56 minutes\u2014the time it takes Earth to turn once relative to the stars. The strongest interference seemed to come from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, which optical astronomy suggested was the center of the Milky Way. In 1933, Jansky published a paper in <a href=\"https://proceedingsoftheieee.ieee.org/about/history/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers</em></em></a> with a provocative title: \u201c<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.1998.681378\" target=\"_blank\">Electrical Disturbances Apparently of Extraterrestrial Origin</a>.\u201d He had opened the electromagnetic spectrum up to astronomers, even though he never got to pursue radio astronomy himself. The interference he had defined was, to him, \u201cstar noise.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-two years later, two other Bell Labs scientists, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1978/penzias/biographical/\" target=\"_blank\">Arno Penzias</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1978/wilson/facts/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Wilson</a>, ran into some interference of their own. In 1965 they were trying to adapt a <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NHLS/89002457_text\" target=\"_blank\">horn antenna</a> in Holmdel for radio astronomy\u2014but there was a hiss, in the <a href=\"https://aether.lbl.gov/www/science/cmb.html\" target=\"_blank\">microwave</a> band, coming from all parts of the sky. They had no idea what it was. They ruled out interference from New York City, not far to the north. They rewired the receiver. They cleaned out bird droppings in the antenna. Nothing worked.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a large triangular structure on a frame, with two people looking up at it.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fa4de\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-large-triangular-structure-on-a-frame-with-two-people-looking-up-at-it.jpg?id=62822141&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In the 1960s, Arno Penzias and Robert W.

They theorized that it would have left a hiss, in the microwave band, coming from all parts of the sky. They\u2019d begun to build an antenna. Then Dicke got a phone call from Penzias and Wilson, looking for help. \u201cWell, boys, we\u2019ve been scooped,\u201d he famously said when the call was over. Penzias and Wilson had accidentally found the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/big-bang-theory-discovery\" target=\"_self\">cosmic microwave background</a>, or CMB, the leftover radiation from the big bang.</p><p>Burns and his colleagues are figurative heirs to Jansky, Penzias, and Wilson. Researchers suggest that the giveaway signature of the cosmic dark ages may be a <a href=\"https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=221439\" target=\"_blank\">minuscule dip</a> in the CMB. They theorize that dark-ages hydrogen may be detectable only because it has been absorbing a little bit of the microwave energy from the dawn of the universe.</p><h2>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress </h2><p>The plan for Blue Ghost Mission 2 is to touch down soon after the sun has risen at the landing site. That will give mission managers two weeks to check out the spacecraft, take pictures, conduct other experiments that Blue Ghost carries, and charge LuSEE-Night\u2019s battery pack with its photovoltaic panels. Then, as local sunset comes, they\u2019ll turn everything off except for the LuSEE-Night receiver and a bare minimum of support systems.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Image of the moon's surface, with a closeup of one section. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5b48b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image-of-the-moon-s-surface-with-a-closeup-of-one-section.png?id=62815382&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">LuSEE-Night will land at a site [orange dot] that\u2019s about 25 degrees south of the moon\u2019s equator and opposite the center of the moon\u2019s face as seen from Earth.

That is, if their equipment doesn\u2019t freeze or fry first.</p><p>A major task for LuSEE-Night is to protect the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07173v1\" target=\"_blank\">electronics</a> that run it. <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/weather-on-the-moon/\" target=\"_blank\">Temperature extremes</a> are the biggest problem. Systems can be hardened against cosmic radiation, and a sturdy spacecraft should be able to handle the stresses of launch, flight, and landing. But how do you build it to last when temperatures range between 120 and \u2212130 \u00b0C? With layers of insulation? Electric heaters to reduce nighttime chill?</p><p>\u201cAll of the above,\u201d says Burns. To reject daytime heat, there will be a multicell parabolic radiator panel on the outside of the equipment bay. To keep warm at night, there will be battery power\u2014a lot of battery power. Of LuSEE-Night\u2019s launch mass of 108 kg, about 38 kg is a lithium-ion battery pack with a capacity of 7,160 watt-hours, mostly to generate heat. The battery cells will recharge photovoltaically after the sun rises. The all-important spectrometer has been programmed to cycle off periodically during the two weeks of darkness, so that the battery\u2019s state of charge doesn\u2019t drop below 8 percent; better to lose some observing time than lose the entire apparatus and not be able to revive it.</p><h2>Lunar Radio Astronomy for the Long Haul </h2><p>And if they can\u2019t revive it? Burns has been through that before. In 2024 he watched helplessly as Odysseus, the first U.S.-made lunar lander in 50 years, touched down\u2014and then went silent for 15 agonizing minutes until controllers in Texas realized they were receiving only occasional pings instead of detailed data. Odysseus <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lunar-landing-intuitive-machines\" target=\"_self\">had landed</a> hard, snapped a leg, and ended up lying almost on its side.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Color photo of a metal structure inside an open rocket.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"97286\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-a-metal-structure-inside-an-open-rocket.png?id=62822546&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">ROLSES-1, shown here inside a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, was the first radio telescope to land on the moon, in February 2024. During a hard landing, one leg broke, making it difficult for the telescope to send readings back to Earth.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Intuitive Machines/SpaceX</small></p><p>As part of its scientific cargo, Odysseus carried <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2503.09842v2#S3\" target=\"_blank\">ROLSES-1</a> (Radiowave Observations on the Lunar Surface of the photo-Electron Sheath), an experiment Burns and a friend had suggested to NASA years before. It was partly a test of technology, partly to study the complex interactions between sunlight, radiation, and lunar soil\u2014there\u2019s enough electric charge in the soil sometimes that dust particles levitate above the moon\u2019s surface, which could potentially mess with radio observations. But Odysseus was damaged badly enough that instead of a week\u2019s worth of data, ROLSES got 2 hours, most of it recorded before the landing. A grad student working with Burns, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Joshua-J-Hibbard-2182593048\" target=\"_blank\">Joshua Hibbard</a>, managed to partially salvage the experiment and prove that ROLSES had worked: Hidden in its raw data were <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ae18d8\" target=\"_blank\">signals from Earth and the Milky Way</a>.</p><p>\u201cIt was a harrowing experience,\u201d Burns said afterward, \u201cand I\u2019ve told my students and friends that I don\u2019t want to be first on a lander again. I want to be second, so that we have a greater chance to be successful.\u201d He says he feels good about LuSEE-Night being on the Blue Ghost 2 mission, especially after the successful Blue Ghost 1 landing. The ROLSES experiment, meanwhile, will get a second chance: ROLSES-2 has been scheduled to fly on <a href=\"https://fireflyspace.com/missions/blue-ghost-mission-3/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Ghost Mission 3</a>, perhaps in 2028.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Artist\\u2019s rendering of a gray surface with parallel zigzagging lines.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"bbc57\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/artist-u2019s-rendering-of-a-gray-surface-with-parallel-zigzagging-lines.png?id=62821827&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">NASA\u2019s plan for the FarView Observatory lunar radio telescope array, shown in an artist\u2019s rendering, calls for 100,000 dipole antennas to be spread out over 200 square kilometers.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ronald Polidan </small></p><p>If LuSEE-Night succeeds, it will doubtless raise questions that require much <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03418\" target=\"_blank\">more ambitious radio telescopes</a>. Burns, Hallinan, and others have already gotten early NASA funding for a giant interferometric array on the moon called <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117724003405?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">FarView</a>. It would consist of a grid of 100,000 antenna nodes spread over 200 square kilometers, made of aluminum <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/blue-origin-molten-regolith-electrolysis\" target=\"_self\">extracted from lunar soil</a>. They say assembly could begin as soon as the 2030s, although political and budget realities may get in the way.</p><p>Through it all, Burns has gently pushed and prodded and lobbied, advocating for a lunar observatory through the terms of ten NASA administrators and seven U.S. presidents. He\u2019s probably learned more about Washington politics than he ever wanted. American presidents have a habit of reversing the space priorities of their predecessors, so missions have sometimes proceeded full force, then languished for years. With LuSEE-Night finally headed for launch, Burns at times sounds buoyant: \u201cJust think. We\u2019re actually going to do cosmology from the moon.\u201d At other times, he\u2019s been blunt: \u201cI never thought\u2014none of us thought\u2014that it would take 40 years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike anything in science, there\u2019s no guarantee,\u201d says Burns. \u201cBut we need to look.\u201d <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>",

In such networks, multiple AI agents optimize the network to achieve distinct and often competing objectives. As such, conflicts become inevitable and have the potential to degrade performance, cause instability, and disrupt service. Current approaches for conflict detection rely on conflict graphs created based on relationships between AI agents, parameters, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Existing works often rely on complex and computationally expensive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and depend on manually chosen thresholds to create conflict graphs. In this work, we present the first systematic framework for conflict detection in AI-native mobile networks, propose a two-tower encoder architecture for learning interactions based on data from the RAN, and introduce a data-driven sparsity-based mechanism for autonomously reconstructing conflict graphs without manual fine-tuning.",

However, the inherent mobility and high-altitude operation of NTN pose significant challenges throughout the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle. To address these challenges, integrating NTNs with the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) is a promising approach, since ORAN can offer disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and embedded intelligence. Despite extensive literature on ORAN and NTN, a holistic view of ORAN-based NTN frameworks is still lacking, particularly regarding how ORAN can effectively address the existing challenges of NTN. Furthermore, although artificial intelligence native (AI-Native) capabilities have the potential to enhance intelligence network control and optimization, their practical realization in NTNs has not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of AI-Native ORAN for NTN. This paper commences with an in-depth review of the existing literature and subsequently introduces the necessary background about ORAN, NTN, and AI-Native for communication. After analyzing the DevOps challenges for NTN, we propose the orchestrated AI-Native ORAN-based NTN framework and discuss its key technological enablers.

A critical challenge is effectively decomposing E2E Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into domain-specific SLAs, which current solutions handle through computationally intensive, iterative optimization processes that incur substantial latency and complexity. To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer. The model is trained under a learning paradigm inspired by Domain-Informed Neural Networks (DINNs), incorporating risk-informed modeling and amortized optimization to learn a stable, forward-only SLA decomposition policy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Casformer achieves improved SLA decomposition quality against state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, while exhibiting enhanced scalability and robustness under volatile and noisy network conditions. In addition, its forward-only design reduces runtime complexity and simplifies deployment and maintenance. These insights reveal the potential of combining amortized optimization with Transformer-based sequence modeling to advance network automation, providing a scalable and efficient solution suitable for real-time SLA management in advanced 5G-and-beyond network environments.",

The AVs can deploy AI agents powered by large AI models as personalized assistants, on edge servers to support intelligent driving decision making and enhanced on-board experiences. However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating the location reported when AVs request LBS in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality. To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality. In this framework, a new privacy metric, termed cross-reality location entropy, is proposed to effectively quantify the privacy levels of AVs. Based on this metric, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the hybrid action, focusing on achieving a balance between location protection, service latency reduction, and quality of service maintenance. To solve the complex mixed-integer problem, we develop a novel LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which integrates LLM-driven informative reward design to enhance environment understanding with double Generative Diffusion Models-based policy exploration to handle high-dimensional action spaces, thereby enabling reliable determination of optimal hybrid actions.

Unlike most prior studies based on 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) templates, we leverage real-world deployment and traffic data from a commercial 4G/5G network in China to evaluate practical 6G strategies. Using Giulia-a deployment-informed system-level heterogeneous network model-we show that 6G can boost median throughput by up to 9.5x over heterogeneous 4G+5G deployments, but also increases power usage by up to 59%. Critically, co-locating 6G with existing sites delivers limited gains while incurring high energy cost. In contrast, non-co-located, traffic-aware deployments achieve superior throughput-to-watt efficiency, highlighting the need for strategic, user equipment (UE) hotspot-focused 6G planning.",

This evolution, while bringing numerous advantages, will also pose challenges, especially in mobility management, as it will increase the overall number of handovers due to smaller coverage areas and the higher signal attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning based algorithm for predicting the future serving cell utilizing sequential user equipment measurements to minimize the handover failures and interruption time. Our algorithm enables network operators to dynamically adjust handover triggering events or incorporate UAV base stations for enhanced coverage and capacity, optimizing network objectives like load balancing and energy efficiency through transfer learning techniques. Our framework complies with the O-RAN specifications and can be deployed in a Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller as an xApp leveraging the E2SM-KPM service model. The evaluation results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a 92% accuracy in predicting future serving cells with high probability. Finally, by utilizing transfer learning, our algorithm significantly reduces the retraining time by 91% and 77% when new handover trigger decisions or UAV base stations are introduced to the network dynamically.",
