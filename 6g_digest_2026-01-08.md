This research evaluates user-centric Massive MIMO architectures for 6G networks using high-fidelity 3D Ray-Tracing simulations. It demonstrates that moving away from cell-based structures to a model where multiple base stations serve a single user simultaneously can triple throughput for users at the edge of traditional coverage areas.

### [AI-Enabled Digital Twins for Next-Generation Networks: Forecasting Traffic and Resource Management in 5G/6G](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20796)
> **Relevance Score:** 3 (AI Impact: 7) | 📅 2026-01-08

This research explores the integration of AI-driven Digital Twins (DTs) into the architecture of 5G and 6G networks to address the complexities of real-time service provisioning. By utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks within a Digital Twin Network (DTN) framework, the study demonstrates a method for proactive traffic forecasting and autonomous resource allocation, aiming to replace traditional heuristic management with high-precision virtual replicas.
